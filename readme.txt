OK, so

app.js is the main thing it loads into, and lines 24 onwards renders index, but it doesnt update the title also, but thats the same code as the issue we're trying to solve

package just has shit in it

views is not part of this equation, its all being handled in SRC.


bookRoutes contains the code im presently working on, lines 20 and onwards is the same as app ln 24 onward

books.ejs and index.ejs are identical, apart from line 60, where the header is changed to show that you're on /books easier

they both have code changed lines 30 to ~40

index.txt is unused older ejs stuff, and public contains all prefab stuff

good luck.
